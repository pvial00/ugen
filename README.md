# ugen

ugen is a uniform password string genertor.  It generates passwords using A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and OWASP special characters to create the most secure and uniformly distributed passwords.

ugen's core is a CSPRNG.  An initial 16 byte seed is generated by /dev/urandom and reduced mod 95 to become the key and data used in the underlying cipher that operates mod 95.  Any bias is removed by the encrypting of the seed data.

The standard number of iterations to pass over the seed data is 10,000.

ugen will generate up to 1 Megabyte password strings and as little as 1.

The algorithm ugen is based on is the RedDye cipher.  More information here -> https://github.com/pvial00/RedDye
